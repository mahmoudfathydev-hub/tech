ECOMMERCE DATA FETCHING ARCHITECTURE REPORT
==========================================

Date: 2026-02-25
Objective: Implement a clean, scalable, and efficient data fetching strategy using React/Next.js and DummyJSON API.

COMPLETED TASKS:

1. TYPE SYSTEM (/src/types/product.ts)
   - Created 'Product' and 'ProductsResponse' interfaces to ensure strict type safety across the application.

2. API SERVICE (/src/api/products.ts)
   - Implemented 'fetchAllProducts' function.
   - Fetches 4 categories (smartphones, laptops, tablets, mobile-accessories) in parallel using Promise.all.
   - Merges results into a single unified array.
   - Designed to be easily integrated with React Query or other caching layers.

3. STATE MANAGEMENT (/src/context/ProductContext.tsx)
   - Created a 'ProductProvider' to hold global product data.
   - Implemented 'useProducts' custom hook for easy data access.
   - handles the initial 'fetch-once' logic on app mount.

4. LOCAL LOGIC (ZERO-REQUEST SEARCH & SORTING)
   - Local Filtering: Implemented 'filteredProducts' using useMemo. Filtering happens in memory whenever the user types in the search bar.
   - Local Sorting: Implemented 'bestSellers' logic using useMemo to sort by rating locally.
   - RESULT: Zero additional API requests for search or category filtering.

5. UI COMPONENTS
   - /src/components/BestSeller: A premium, horizontal scrolling section matching the Hero design, using AOS animations and high-end styling.
   - /src/components/Products/SearchBar.tsx: A sleek search input tied to the local search state.
   - /src/components/Products/ProductList.tsx: A responsive grid displaying filtered results.

6. APP INTEGRATION (/src/app/layout.tsx)
   - Wrapped the root layout with 'ProductProvider' to make the data available globally.

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
/src
  /api              -> fetch functions (API logic)
  /context          -> react context (state & local logic)
  /types            -> typescript interfaces
  /components
    /BestSeller     -> Premium Best Seller section
    /Products       -> Listing and Search components

BENEFITS:
- Performance: Only one complex fetch request; navigation and search are instant.
- Scalability: Separated concerns make it easy to migrate to React Query or a custom backend.
- Maintainability: Centralized logic for filtering and sorting avoids code duplication.
